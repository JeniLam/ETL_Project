CMOA was a datafile where birthdates and deathdates might be:
M/D/Y
Y-M-D
Y-M-D|Y-M-D (multiple artists)

Corrected in Excel:

1) Text to columns (Delimited |) to remove 2nd, 3rd dates.(export to next col)
2) Text to columns (Delimited /) to separate year column for m/y/d
3) Text to columns (delimited -) to separate year column for y-m-d
4) New column collects years: (=IF(E3="",F3,E3))
5) Remove the 0 from blank rows: (=IF(G3=0,"",G3))
